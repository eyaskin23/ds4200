            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Our DS3000 final project focuses on understanding and predicting drug overdose incidents using data science techniques. The project explores polydrug use and demographic factors to develop targeted public health interventions. By using various machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees, we aim to identify patterns and provide insights that could reduce the occurrence of overdoses. Each model allows us to analyze the data differently: KNN helps us understand age-related trends, Decision Trees identify drug-specific risk factors, and SVM categorizes incidents based on severity and type.

            <p>
                One of the main goals of this project is to find effective ways to reduce drug overdoses by focusing on polydrug use. This term refers to the combination of multiple substances, which increases the risk of severe outcomes. Our team believes that, by identifying patterns in polydrug use among different demographics, we can assist public health officials in tailoring education, prevention, and treatment efforts specifically for those most at risk. We also explore the prevalence of specific drugs like heroin and cocaine and how their usage varies among different age groups. 
            </p>
            <p>
                By integrating demographic and geographical information, the project provides a comprehensive view that can be used to implement preventive strategies where they are needed most. Using these predictive models, we hope to contribute actionable insights to public health campaigns aimed at minimizing the impact of drug overdoses.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                The DS3000 final project has provided valuable insights into drug overdose trends and risk factors using machine learning models. By understanding these patterns, we aim to inform public health initiatives and develop targeted strategies that minimize overdose incidents.
