            <p>
                Hi, I am Evelyn Yaskin, a current sophomore at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. Through Northeastern, I am pursuing a double Bachelor of Science in computer science and design, specializing in artificial intelligence and UX design. My passion for digital arts and technology began when I enrolled in a digital technology academy in high school, where I explored graphic design, music technology, and programming. This early exposure allowed me to build a strong foundation in creative and technical skills, which I continue to develop at Northeastern.

                At university, I have integrated my previous knowledge of the digital world while expanding my understanding of human-computer interactions and physical design computations. I’ve gained hands-on experience through projects focusing on user experience, interface design, and AI systems, which have broadened my perspective on the intersection of technology and design. I am actively involved in the Northeastern community, playing tennis on the intramural sports team and participating in the Women In Tech Club (NUWIT), where I connect with like-minded peers and professionals.

                In my free time, you can find me exploring Boston’s vibrant art scene, experimenting with photography, or enjoying a warm cup of coffee at Pavement Coffeehouse. I’m always eager to embrace new challenges and opportunities to expand my technical and creative horizons.
